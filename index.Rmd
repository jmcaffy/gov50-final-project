## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to public and private education systems in the U.S. and do a comparative analysis of the two data sets. One idea is to look at the overall success of students (SAT scores, graduation rates, etc) in order to establish a potential causal aspect of the success of each of these schools. Not exactly sure how specific I would get with the data set. Depends on what data I have available.
